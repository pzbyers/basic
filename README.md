## Notes

Although google does not take meta tags into consideration when doing search ranking (and hasn't done so for a decade) it can use them to display snippets of your website in the search results which can influence a users descision on whether or not to visit your website.  For that reason i have included only a couple of meta tags but by ensuring content is well structured and descriptive, this should ensure that the website is viewed favourably by search engines.
